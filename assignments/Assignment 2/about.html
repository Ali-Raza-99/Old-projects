<h2 id="sql">SQL Language:</h2>
<p>SQL is an abbreviation for structured query language, and pronounced either see-kwell or as separate letters. SQL is a standardized query language for requesting information from a database. The original version called SEQUEL (structured English query language) was designed by an IBM research center in 1974 and 1975.</p>

<h2 id="python">Python Language:</h2>
<p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. ... Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.</p>

<h2 id="c">C Language:</h2>
<p>The C language is a  basic programming language and it is a very popular language, particularly used in game programming, Because C language includes the additional packing of the C++, Every programmer uses this language because it makes programs faster . However the value of this language gives the reusability of C++ to get the slight increase in performance with C language.
</p>


<h2 id="pascal">Pascal Language:</h2>
<p>Pascal language is mostly a teaching language and few industries uses this language to write the programs. This language tends to use keywords instead of symbols and braces in C language. So this language is very easy for beginners to understand than a programming language like C, C++. Borland is a compiler software company, which is using Delphi programming language for industrial strength. Delphi is an object oriented language of Pascal, and presently  Borland compilers only use it.
</p>

<h2 id="fortran">Fortran Language:</h2>
<p>
Fortran language is a number crunching language and still it is used by scientists. This language allows different sizes of variables up to the memory limit in the machine. This language is suitable for engineers, who have to calculate values with high precision. Program in Fortran is inflexible and sometimes it makes difficult to read.
</p>

<h2 id="java">Java Language:</h2>
<p>The Java language is a multi platform language thatâ€™s particularly helpful in networking. Of course, mostly this language is used on the web with Java applets. However, this language is used to design cross platform programs, Since it similar to C++ in structure and syntax. For C++ programmers, Java language is very easy to learn and it offers some advantages provided by object oriented  programming. Like reusability and it can be difficult to write efficient code in Java. But, nowadays the speed of the Java language has increased and 1.5 version offers some good features for easy program making.
</p>

<h2 id="perl">Perl Language:</h2>
<p>Perl language is a file management language for UNIX. But it is more popular for its common gateway interface programming (CGI). It is a term for programs that web servers can perform to allow additional capabilities of web pages. Pearl language is a method for searching text and it is used for useful server functions and other databases, and it is very easy to pick up the fundamentals if you have any experience in any language. As a CGi language, web hosting services select Perl language over C++ language. Because, the web hosts can review Perl script files. Since they are text files, when C++ is compiled.
</p>

<h2 id="php">PHP Language:</h2>
<p>The PHP language is used to design web pages and sometimes it is also used as scripting language. This language is designed to develop a rapid website, and as a result comprises features which make it easy generate HTTP headers and link to databases. As a scripting language, it includes a set of components permit the programmer to easily get up to speed. However, it has more  sophisticated object oriented features.</p>

<h2 id="rust">Rust Language:</h2>
<p>Image result for rust programming language short definition
Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. ... It has gained increasing use in industry, and Microsoft has been experimenting with the language for secure and safety-critical software components.</p>
<h2 id="ruby">Ruby Language:</h2>
<p>Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan. ... It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.</p>

<h2 id="swift">Swift Language:</h2>
<p>Swift is a high-level programming language developed by Apple and made available in 2014. It is designed for writing apps for Apple platforms, including macOS, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS. The Swift language is based on Objective-C, which was used for NeXTSTEP development in the 1980s, and later macOS and iOS.</p>
